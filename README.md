Property management is a critical aspect of a property performing to its full potential. Poorly managed properties end up costing the owner of a property significantly in a variety of different ways. A few of these include lost income, additional expenses, physical deterioration, additional exposure to lawsuits, and loss of goodwill from tenants.

A property management system has been developed which takes care of listings, agents, prices, customers, accounts and even take care of customer relationship management (CRM), giving a platform for the customer to interact with the real estate agent through the mail.
